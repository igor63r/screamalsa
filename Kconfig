	  Say Y or M if you want to add support for ScreamALSA virtual sound card.
	  
	  ScreamALSA creates a virtual ALSA sound card that streams audio data
	  over network using UDP or TCP protocol. It supports both MMAP and R/W
	  modes and sends audio packets of 1152 bytes each.
	  
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called snd-screamalsa.
	  
	  If unsure, say N.
